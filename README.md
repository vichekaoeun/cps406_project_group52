## Executive Summary:
The purpose of this program is to let users input bugs/errors into a database. The program should
be an easy and friendly script where the user can easily figure out how to implement it. Users
will need internet connection and certain network abilities enabled for the web form to work
properly.
## Purpose:
The Bug Reporting System (BRS) is intended to help the user keep track of bugs/defects in
design documents, diagrams, formal specs, source files, test source files, binaries and data
files. Tracking of the bug will be done by means of keeping track of the “originator” of the
bug, type of bug, short description, and any other data that is relevant. This will allow users
to keep track of the progress of the defect fix.

## Brief Information:
Here's some info about our main files, In "app.py", we've built a Flask app to manage user registration and accounts. 
It talks to a SQLite database, securely storing passwords and providing features like password resets and username updates. 
"databaseSet.py" ensures smooth database operations for our Flask app, setting up connections and configuring settings 
like timeout for locks. "functions.py" helps with database interactions, like validating credentials, fetching posts, and adding comments. 
Lastly, "loaddata.py" handles saving user info for login and system use.
